# DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics

### Project Overview
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data provided by Global Electronics. The goal is to uncover valuable insights from customer, product, sales, and store data, and provide actionable recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive overall business growth. The project involves data cleaning, data storage, and visualization to provide real-time insights and support strategic decision-making.

### Data Set
Source: Global Electronics' internal databases
Format: Structured data stored in a SQL database
Required Fields: Customer demographics, product specifications, sales transactions, store details, and currency exchange rates
Task List
Set Up Environment: Install required libraries and set up the project environment.

Programming: Python, SQL
Libraries Used: pandas, numpy, SQLAlchemy, Power BI, datetime, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
Convert data types where necessary (e.g., dates, numerical values).
Merge datasets where necessary for analysis (e.g., linking sales data with product and customer data).
Data Storage:

Insert the preprocessed data into an SQL database by creating relevant tables for each data source.
The database schema includes the following tables: customers, products, sales, stores, and currency_exchange.
Power BI Visualization:

Connect SQL to Power BI, import the data, and create interactive dashboards.
Develop SQL Queries:

Formulate and execute 10 SQL queries to extract key insights from the data. These queries should address important business questions and support the analysis steps below.

### Analysis Steps
Customer Analysis:

Demographic Distribution: Analyze the distribution of customers based on gender, age, and location.
Purchase Patterns: Identify purchasing patterns such as average order value, frequency of purchases, and preferred products.
Segmentation: Segment customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior to identify key customer groups.
Sales Analysis:

Overall Sales Performance: Analyze total sales over time, identifying trends and seasonality.
Sales by Product: Evaluate which products are the top performers in terms of quantity sold and revenue generated.
Sales by Store: Assess the performance of different stores based on sales data.
Sales by Currency: Examine how different currencies impact sales figures, considering exchange rates.
Product Analysis:

Product Popularity: Identify the most and least popular products based on sales data.
Profitability Analysis: Calculate profit margins for products by comparing unit cost and unit price.
Category Analysis: Analyze sales performance across different product categories and subcategories.
Store Analysis:

Store Performance: Evaluate store performance based on sales, size (square meters), and operational data.
Geographical Analysis: Analyze sales by store location to identify high-performing regions.

### Use Cases

Marketing Strategies: Enhance marketing strategies by understanding customer demographics and purchasing behaviors.
Inventory Management: Optimize inventory management based on sales patterns and product popularity.
Sales Forecasting: Improve sales forecasting through analysis of historical sales data and trends.
Store Operations: Inform store expansion and optimization decisions based on store performance and geographical analysis.
Pricing Strategies: Develop better international pricing strategies by understanding the impact of currency exchange rates on sales.

### Future Enhancements
Real-Time Updates: Implement real-time data updates to keep the information current.
Enhanced Filtering: Add more filtering options and advanced search capabilities in Power BI.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the successful application of data cleaning, storage, and interactive data visualization techniques to solve real-world problems in the retail electronics industry. The skills and methodologies developed in this project can be applied to various domains requiring data extraction, analysis, and visualization.
